description: "I designed and fabricated ten hardware enclosures for a telemetry system to provide real time winter weather and road condition updates to the Nevada Department of Transportation (NDOT), by utilizing their own vehicles operating in the Sierra Nevada foothills and mountains. This telemetry system allows NDOT to more effectively allocate their resources (snow plows, salt, etc.) in the places needed the most. In addition to taking weather readings, this system also monitors the rate at which salt is being spread onto the ground, and senses when there is no longer any salt in the back of the plow."

        description: "The bulk of the hardware for this telemetry system is mounted inside the cab, where it is protected from the weather. I was responsible for designing a layout for the hardware and its enclosure that was within the spatial limitations for fitting it behind the passenger seat in the cab of the NDOT snow plows. After the layout was finalized, I built a prototype of the backplate (shown above) with mounting holes for the hardware, to confirm the dimensions for the mounting holes were correct."

        description: "After the backplate layout was confirmed, I worked with a vendor to machine the backplate. I then finalized the c-channel and cover design, ensuring the process of mounting the enclosure to the wall of the cab of the snow plow would not be difficult."
