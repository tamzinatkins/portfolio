description: "I worked at a defense contractor, Sierra Nevada Corporation, modeling parts and performing finite element analyses of the automatic carrier landing system (ACLS) on board US Navy aircraft carriers. Components must be robust and comply with high military standards. I was part of a team of three engineers, and my work was focused around creating detailed models for visual presentations, and simplified models for engineering analyses."
#The ACLS's purpose is to reduce landing accidents of carrier-based aircraft.

        description: "My first project was to create detailed 3D CAD models to show the product to the customer and update the company's PLM library. After I finished the components I was responsible for, I simplified them to a combination of solid and surface models to minimize the computation run time for FEA. These analyses were run to confirm design changes fixed known failure points."

        description: "This yoke is the first component I modeled. My manager deemed this to be the \"most complicated\" part of the product the team was responsible for modeling, and despite the fact it was my first week there, I gladly accepted the challenge of reproducing this from its 2D drawings in a timely manner. I exceeded expectations by completing the yoke after focusing on it for 3 weeks. "

       -  Surfacing techniques (including swept surfaces, filled surfaces)
       
       -  Importance of leaving fillets and chamfers for last, to ease rollback issues

       - Hole Wizard and Configuration Manager in SolidWorks
       
       -  Femap & LS-DYNA (FEA software)"
