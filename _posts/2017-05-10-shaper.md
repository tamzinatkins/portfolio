description: "My work at Shaper centered around preparing for the engineering validation test (EVT) build for Shaper Origin. Shaper Origin is a handheld CNC router - revolutionizing how we build.  I was responsible for assembling functional prototypes and designing assembly fixtures. I conducted daily inventories as parts arrived to ensure assemblies went smoothly. After gaining insight on the assembly process, I designed several necessary assembly fixtures that were identified by the engineering team. In addition, I created sub-assembly drawings to accompany assembly instructions and for design verification."
