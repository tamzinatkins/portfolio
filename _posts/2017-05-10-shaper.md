description: "My work at Shaper Tools centers around preparing for the engineering validation test (EVT) and design validation test (DVT) builds, as well as the production of Shaper Origin. Shaper Origin is a handheld CNC router - revolutionizing how we build.  I am responsible for building and maintaining functional prototype units, designing assembly fixtures, and creating manufacturing and assembly drawings. I have recently been creating assembly fixtures using the tool itself, allowing me to spend time using Origin, and enabling me to rapidly prototype."
#After gaining insight on the assembly process, I designed several necessary assembly fixtures that were identified by the engineering team. In addition, I created part sub-assembly drawings to accompany assembly instructions and for design verification. I conduct inventories as parts arrive to ensure an organized lab space.
