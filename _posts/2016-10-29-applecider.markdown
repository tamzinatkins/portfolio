        description: "I took photos of a pre-existing apple press to replicate in SolidWorks, so I can build one in the future. It is made primarily out of wood and aluminum extrusions. I utilized the Structural Steel feature within the SolidWorks Toolbox Add-In to ensure I was using standard materials I can purchase. Even though it is labeled for steel, there are identical c-channels and equal leg angles made from 6061 Aluminum available at Metals Depot, a supplier I have purchased from before."

        description: "The bearing helps facilitate the compression of the apple pulp. The hydrodynamic bearing is lubricated with vegetable oil, in order to not introduce liquids that are not meant for human consumption. The two bearing plates are completely separate components (they appear together in the shown model); the top half is attached to the threaded rod, and the bottom half is attached to the pressing plate. Once the pulp bucket has been filled with apple pulp, the user slides the bucket to the other end of the press, where it sits under the threaded rod. The pressing plate is then placed on top of the pulp. When the user cranks the disc at the top of the threaded rod, the pressing plate is pushed down onto the apple pulp and the juice is extracted into a large bowl below the spout."

        description: "After doing research on where to find a simple hydrodynamic bearing, like the one used on my cousin's 60+ year old press (and not having much success), the most viable option is to use a lathe or CNC and make one myself."

        description: "I plan on making design changes to the handles of the disc where the user turns in order to compress the apple pulp. For the design shown here, a piece of 2x4 was wedged between the four knobs to increase the torque to make it easier to compress the apple pulp."

    {
     description: "Possible solutions to increase leverage include:

     - Welding a large, standard sized hex head, centered on the top of the disc, and use a socket wrench to spin the press.

    - Welding a square head (instead of the hex head), and use a valve key."
