description: I am modeling an apple press for a personal project. I was inspired to model this apple press after making apple cider with relatives.

        description: "The bearing helps facilitate the compression of the apple pulp. The hydrodynamic bearing is lubricated with vegetable oil, in order to not introduce liquids that are not meant for human consumption. The two bearing plates are on separate components; the top half is attached to the threaded rod, and the bottom half is attached to the pressing plate. When the user cranks the disc at the top of the threaded rod, the pressing plate is pushed down onto the apple pulp, to extract the juice."

        description: "I plan on making design changes to the handles of the disc where the user turns in order to compress the apple pulp. For the design shown here, a piece of 2x4 was wedged between the four knobs to increase the torque to make it easier to compress the apple pulp."
    },
    {
     description: "Possible solutions to increase leverage include:

     1) Weld a hexagonal piece (like a hex head, but of a standard size) centered on the top of the disc and use a large socket wrench head that can sit over the hexagonal piece and the user can spin the device.

    2) Weld a square head (instead of the hex head above), and use a valve key."
