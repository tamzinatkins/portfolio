description: "My undergraduate senior project was to design and fabricate a portable bowling kit, where the bowling pins are reset via remote control. Working as part of a team, one of my tasks was to create the remote. I used two Arduino boards, a transmitter/receiver kit, and an SBC (single board computer) to send communication from the buttons on the controller to the motor responsible for raising and lowering the bowling pins, utilizing PWM.

         description: "The remote case was designed to be inexpensive when it was 3D printed. My first iteration was a longer and thinner rectangular prism, and was more expensive than I expected. I redesigned the cover to be more cubic, decreasing the price of printing by approximately 40%. Standoffs help secure the hardware and keep the wiring tidy by running along the underside of the protoboards."

        description: "If I did this again, I would:

 1) Use a different method or research heat inserts to screw together the two parts. I screwed directly into the plastic.

2) Make the opening for the power switch smaller and use a cleaner method to secure the power switch so the remote keeps its clean aesthetic."

        description: "What I learned:

 Designing for 3D printing (adding fillets to reduce stress points)

- The need for support material when 3D printing

- How a state machine works (programming)

- About SBCs - working with a Raspberry Pi

- About transmitters and receivers, and how vital it is to get the length of the antenna correct"
