description: "My undergraduate senior project was to design and fabricate a portable bowling kit, where the bowling pins are reset via remote control. Working as part of a five person team, I was elected team leader by the group to ensure the project was on track and members were completing their respective tasks that were collectively agreed upon. To learn more about my senior project, click <a href=\"https://mechecapstone.blogs.unr.edu/previous-projects/2016-teams-2/team-6/\">here</a>."

        description: "One of my delegated tasks was to create the remote. I used two Arduino boards, a transmitter/receiver kit, and an SBC (single board computer) to send communication from the buttons on the controller to the motor responsible for raising and lowering the bowling pins, utilizing PWM (pulse width modulation)."

         description: "The remote case was designed to be inexpensive when it was 3D printed. My first iteration was a longer and thinner rectangular prism, and was more expensive than I expected. I redesigned the cover to be more cubic, decreasing the price of printing by approximately 40%. Standoffs help secure the hardware and keep the wiring tidy by running along the underside of the protoboards."

        description: "The remote case was designed to be compact and inexpensive. The controller has four buttons (although only two were used), as well as a power switch. One button raises the pins, and the second button lowers the pins. The case is screwed together at four corners."

    {
        description: "If I made this remote again, I would:

 - Research heat-set threaded inserts to screw together the two parts. I screwed directly into the plastic.

- Make the opening for the power switch smaller and use a cleaner method to secure the power switch so the remote keeps its clean aesthetic.

- Place a limit switch at the maximum height of the pin when it is pulled up to be reset, so the reset can be completed with pressing one button instead of two."

    {
        description: "What I learned:

- Designing for 3D printing (adding fillets to reduce stress points)

- The need for support material when 3D printing

- How a state machine works (programming)

- About SBCs (working with a Raspberry Pi)

- About transmitters and receivers, and how vital it is to get the length of the antenna correct"

        description: "I really enjoyed working on this project because I made it from scratch, learned how much fun 3D printing is, and stretched outside my comfort zone to delve further into programming."
