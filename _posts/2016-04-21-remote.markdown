description: "My undergraduate senior project was to design and fabricate a portable bowling kit, where the bowling pins are reset via remote control. Working as part of a team, one of my tasks was to create the remote. I used two SBCs and a transmitter/receiver kit to send communication from the buttons on the controller to the motor responsible for raising and lowering the bowling pins, utilizing PWM.
