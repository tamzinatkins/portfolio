description: "My undergraduate senior project was to design and fabricate a portable bowling kit, where the bowling pins are reset via remote control. Working as part of a team, one of my tasks was to create the remote. I used two Arduino boards, a transmitter/receiver kit, and an SBC (single board computer) to send communication from the buttons on the controller to the motor responsible for raising and lowering the bowling pins, utilizing PWM.

         description: "The remote case was designed to be inexpensive when it was 3D printed. My first iteration was a longer and thinner rectangular prism, and was more expensive than I expected. I redesigned the cover to be more cubic, decreasing the price of printing by approximately 40%. Standoffs help secure the hardware and keep the wiring tidy by running along the underside of the protoboards."
