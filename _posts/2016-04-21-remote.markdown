description: "My senior project during my undergraduate degree was to design and fabricate a portable bowling kit, where the pins are reset via remote control. One of my tasks was to create the remote. I used two SBCs and a transmitter/receiver kit to send and receive communication from the buttons on the controller to the motor attached to the bowling pins using PWM.

        description: I designed the remote case to be compact, easy to open, and inexpensive when it was 3D printed. The controller has four buttons, as well as a power switch. The case is screwed together at four corners to allow the user to be able to repeatedly open and close it.
